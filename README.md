# CPS15_to_CPS2

Converts the 18 MAME CPS1 QSound ("CPS 1.5") sets to CPS2 boards running the
null (phoenix) key. Each converted set is named after its source set plus `c2`
(`wof` → `wofc2`). Every set is written twice: as a MAME ROM set and in Darksoft
flash format.

MAME is the reference. A conversion is accepted when, given the same inputs, it
matches the original CPS1 set in MAME frame by frame: same game RAM, same screen.

| Code base | Sets | Players / buttons |
|---|---|---|
| Warriors of Fate | wof, wofr1, wofu, wofa, wofj | 3P / 2B |
| Cadillacs and Dinosaurs | dino, dinou, dinoj, dinoa | 3P / 2B |
| The Punisher | punisher, punisheru, punisherh, punisherj | 2P / 2B |
| Saturday Night Slam Masters | slammast, slammastu, mbomberj | 4P / 3B |
| Muscle Bomber Duo | mbombrd, mbombrdj | 4P / 3B |

The 3rd and 4th players use the CPS2 kick-harness / extra-player inputs, the same
way Capcom's own CPS2 games do: Alien vs. Predator for 3 players, D&D Tower of
Doom for 4.

```

## Requirements

- Linux, Python 3 (developed on 3.14) with `capstone` (5.x), `pyyaml`, `numpy` and `pillow`:

  ```sh
  pip install capstone pyyaml numpy pillow
  ```

- A C compiler and `make` to build vasm.
- A MAME source tree at `~/mame`, built with the patches below. Development used
  commit `017b8670f0a`. The converter also reads `~/mame/src/mame/capcom/` to
  check the input sets' CRCs.
- The 18 source sets plus `qsound.zip` in `mame_roms/`, as zips matching that MAME
  version.

## Build

### 1. vasm (68k assembler)

vasm is not in the repository: download the source release `vasm.tar.gz` from
<http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/> into `tools/` (git-ignored). Development used vasm
2.0f with the M68k backend 2.8c.

```sh
curl -o tools/vasm.tar.gz http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/release/vasm.tar.gz
mkdir -p tools/build
tar xzf tools/vasm.tar.gz -C tools/build
make -C tools/build/vasm CPU=m68k SYNTAX=mot
# tools/vasm is a committed symlink to build/vasm/vasmm68k_mot
tools/vasm -v
```

### 2. MAME

The test harness needs the opt-in instrumentation. It adds an executed-PC
coverage bitmap (`MAME_COVERAGE_DIR`) and a per-CPU overclock
(`MAME_CPU_OVERCLOCK`), and has no effect unless those variables are set. The 18
driver entries are generated from the converter output, so build MAME after
step 4 (or rebuild it then):

```sh
cd ~/mame
git apply ~/CPS15_to_CPS2/mame/mame_test_instrumentation.patch
make -j14
```

### 3. Coverage traces

The converter uses executed-PC coverage of the **original** sets as evidence.

- 68k: `work/jobs/cov_*_<set>/cov_maincpu.bin`
- Z80: `cov_audiocpu.bin` in any `work/jobs/*_<set>/` folder

Without them it stops with `no Z80 coverage for <set>: run the coverage jobs
first`. Record them with MAME built in step 2:

```sh
python3 -m tools.coverage            # all 18 sets; or name sets: python3 -m tools.coverage wof dino
```

This makes three runs per original set, 54 in all, up to 14 at a time. It takes
about 4 minutes. The runs use fixed input movies, so they are deterministic:

| Run | Movie | Frames |
|---|---|---|
| `cov_smoke_<set>` | coin-up and random play with every player (`movies.smoke`, seed 1) | 20,000 |
| `cov_smoke1p_<set>` | the same with player 1 only (seed 2) | 20,000 |
| `cov_service_<set>` | service menu walk (`movies.service`) | 6,000 |

Each run also logs the game's I/O accesses to `work/jobs/cov_<run>_<set>/iotap.txt`.
`--check` compares those logs with the committed `analysis/iotap/<set>_<run>.txt`.
`--iotap` overwrites the committed logs with the new ones.

The tool reproduces the original traces exactly: all 108 bitmaps and 54 I/O logs
are byte-identical. All 18 sets rebuilt from them are byte-identical too.

### 4. Convert

```sh
python3 -m cps15to2.convert wof wofr1 wofu wofa wofj \
    dino dinou dinoj dinoa \
    punisher punisheru punisherh punisherj \
    slammast slammastu mbomberj mbombrd mbombrdj
```

Each set prints one summary line, for example
`wofc2: cave 0x330e, 140 sites, 19910 overlay tiles`. Builds of different sets are
independent and can run in parallel.

Output:

```
out/mame/<set>c2.zip          MAME set (EPROM split, phoenix.key)
out/mame/<set>c2/             same files unzipped, plus rom_start.inc and manifest.txt
out/darksoft/<set>c2/         flash.NN files, key, NAME (14-char title + "=" + region letter)
```

### 5. Add the sets to MAME

```sh
python3 tools/mame_driver.py      # regenerates the marked block in cps2.cpp and mame.lst
cd ~/mame && make -j14
~/mame/mame -rompath "$HOME/CPS15_to_CPS2/out/mame;$HOME/CPS15_to_CPS2/mame_roms" -verifyroms wofc2
```

`mame_driver.py` only touches the lines between its `BEGIN/END CPS15_TO_CPS2`
markers, and takes the CRCs from `out/mame/*/rom_start.inc`. Rerun it, and
rebuild MAME, after every conversion. Otherwise `-verifyroms` reports CRC
mismatches. The rompath needs both folders, because clones take the QSound BIOS
and parent files from `mame_roms/`. Quote it, since it contains `;`.

## Testing

Tests run headless MAME instances, at most 14 at a time. Inputs come only from
generated movies and pokes; host input devices are disabled.

```sh
# lock-step: original vs. conversion, compares RAM and screen hashes every frame
python3 -m tests.lockstep wof 20000 --movie smoke

# full playthrough without cheats (continues by crediting up), N players
python3 -m tests.playthrough wof 120000 --players 2 --nocheats
```

Both print RAM and screen mismatch counts and the frame ranges where they
happen. `--classify` also runs the original slightly slower (15.8x instead of
16x overclock). A divergence that also appears between the original and itself
at that speed comes from timing, not from the conversion. Results, hashes and
screenshots go to `work/jobs/<tag>_<set>/`.

Some differences are expected:

- **Stack residue:** RAM mismatches confined to the top of the stack area
  (about 34k frames per WoF playthrough). Game state still matches.
- **Speed-sensitive states:** spots where gameplay depends on CPU speed, such as
  Punisher stage 4. These reproduce between the original and itself (see
  `--classify`).

## ROMs and game content

No ROM data is included. You need your own dumps of the source sets.

The repository contains no game code or disassembly. Everything taken from a game
is read from your ROMs at build time:
- code locations: reference-set addresses, matched in each set with signatures taken
  from your reference-set ROM;
- the instructions a hook overwrites: copied into generated trampolines;
- immediate operands and table values;
- the Kabuki keys: read from the MAME tree.

Generated listings (`analysis/*_io_inventory.md`), cheat files and ROM extracts
(`*.bin`) are git-ignored. `analysis/` keeps only measurement logs: addresses,
access counts, register values and tile numbers.

Before committing, check that no game content has slipped in: ROM byte sequences
(looked up in your ROMs) and quoted 68000/Z80 instructions with concrete operands
(in comments, docstrings, specs and other text; HAL comments that quote HAL code
can be marked `contentscan:ok`):

```sh
python3 -m tools.contentscan --worktree  # files on disk that git does not ignore
python3 -m tools.contentscan             # files of HEAD
python3 -m tools.contentscan --history   # every blob in the repository, and commit messages
```
